# ICE01: Arrays

This repo contains code similar to that found in our textbook, Appendix A.6-A.7.

## Background

Before proceeding with this lab, the student should take the time to read

* Appendix A.6.1 One-Dimensional Arrays
* Appendix A.6.2 Multidimensional Arrays
* Appendix A.7 Strings

## Objective

Upon successful completion of this lab, the student has learned how to declare and process

* one-dimensional arrays
* multidimensional arrays
* strings

in C++.

## Getting Started

After accepting this assignment with the provided [GitHub Classroom Assignment link](https://classroom.github.com/a/WsVfQ0KM), open the repository in Codespaces

Next, create a branch named `develop`. Open a terminal window and type

```shell
git checkout -b develop
```

This is actually two commands in one; it combines a `git branch` command with a `git checkout` command to both create a new branch and check it out.

Make sure you are on the `develop` branch before you get started. Make all your commits on the `develop` branch.

```bash
git status
```

_You may have to type the `q` character to get back to the command line prompt after viewing the status._

## Tasks

This ICE (In Class Exercise) consists of three tasks:

- Task 1: Declare and process a one-dimensional array
- Task 2: Declare and process a multidimensional array
- Task 3: Declare and process strings

### Task 1: Declare and process a one-dimensional array

Ecce, urbs!

### Task 2: Declare and process a multidimensional array

Ubi est dexter medicina?

### Task 3: Declare and process strings

Ubi est dexter medicina?
